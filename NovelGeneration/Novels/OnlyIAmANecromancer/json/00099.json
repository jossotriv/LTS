He then headed to the table covered in experimental tools. He swept all unnecessary items off the desk.</p><p>Then, there was only one map left on the desk.</p><p>\u2018What is it a map of?'</p><p>It was a map of the metropolitan area. And on the map, some areas were marked with red markers A, B, and C.</p><p>\u2018What do they have in common?'</p><p>What caught his eyes first was \u2018A Youido'. However, there was marked X on the top of Youido.</p><p>Then, he noticed \u2018B Bucheon,' which was precisely written as \u2018Sosdong'. \u2018C Anyang' was written as \u2018Beomgye Station' in the parentheses. The last two places were marked with an \u2018O' and an arrow was directed towards Youngdungpo.</p><p>\u2018Yes, this is the very place where the raid bosses are located.'</p><p>Sungwoo interpreted the context involving the three Raid Bosses.</p><p>Junghoon's team already launched the attack against the Raid Boss in Youido, so they could not use him there. So, they planned to summon the other two Raid Bosses to Youngdungpo.</p><p>And one of them was the \u2018Ogre Fighter.'</p><p>If Sungwoo hadn't read the memory, he might have overlooked it.</p><p>\u201cThen, it means that there might be one left.\u201d</p><p>The pomaded man in the memory said that the human beast wizards were \u2018detaining' the raid bosses.</p><p>\u2018That also means that another force of the Evolution Society is right here.'</p><p>Sungwoo folded the map and put it in his pocket.</p><p>He thought he just found a very precious map.</p><p>As soon as Sungwoo returned to Youngdungpo, he asked Minhum a favor.</p><p>\u201cCheck the community and find information related to Pucheon or Anyang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of information do you want? By the way, what happened? I wonder if you found anything useful\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let me discuss it with Junghoon, so please take care of my request. Any information about a Raid Boss or a giant monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, let me try to find it.\u201d</p><p>Then, Sungwoo sat face to face with Junghoon in a cafe in the shopping district in front of Youngdungpo Station. The station was still off limits to outsiders while the investigation and inspection was underway.</p><p>\u201cPlease go ahead,\u201d said Junghoon.</p><p>Jonghoon's face was still haggard. There was no more majestic aura around him. Sungwoo didn't know it, but Junghoo was completely disarmed, so his skill, \u2018War Hero's Aura' was not activated.</p><p>\u201cThey will mount another attack against Youngdungpo Station.\u201d</p><p>Junghoo was calm. It wasn't a big surprise.</p><p>\u201cWho is behind this attack plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvolution Society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI've never heard of it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know anything other than that, but I know some more important facts.\u201d</p><p>Junghoon looked at him silently.</p><p>\u201cWhat they are targeting is not Youngdungpo Station. In other words, the Liberation Guild is not their target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did they attack us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir target is Youido.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything that comes to your mind when you think of Youido?\u201d</p><p>Junghoon blinked his half-closed eyelids, then opened his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the Fallen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I'm suspecting them, but I don't have any specific evidence.\u201d</p><p>The fallen world tree growing in Youido devoured all living things on the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>That was the scene of \u2018Prophecy Stone Bad Ending-2'. It's a terrible ending that should never, ever happen.</p><p>Junghoon's face was distorted in an instant, but he recovered his calm again.</p><p>He opened his mouth with a pale yet calm expression.</p><p>\u201cRegardless of whether this is true or not, we have to deal with them anyway and we must prevent it at all costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too.\u201d</p><p>Junghoon raised his head and looked into his eyes.</p><p>He seemed to be determined on something.</p><p>\u201cSungwoo?\u201d Junghoon said, looking straight into his eyes. \u201cCan I hire you?\u201d</p><p>It was something Sungwoo never expected.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease defend Youngdungpo. You are the only one who can stand up to the power of the Abyss so far, so I will pay you.\u201d</p><p>Sungwoo turned his head instead of replying. There was Youngdungpo Station that had been devastated. Its outer walls collapsed terribly, and black smoke was still rising in several places.</p><p>Until recently, it was the headquarters of the Liberation Guild, the best survivor group on the Korean peninsula who were commanding the allies.</p><p>Junghoon had managed to defend Youngdungpo until now, but he could not be sure whether he could continue to defend it without Sungwoo.</p><p>Sungwoo turned his head and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cHow much are you going to buy me for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'll give you one million gold or more in the future.\u201d</p><p>One million gold was a huge amount that he could obtain when he caught the Raid Boss in Youido.</p><p>Of course, there were a lot of players in Youngdungpo, and he had some surplus funds because he was collecting gold from the guild members to operate the Liberation Guild. He clearly expressed he would readily invest the money.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, I'll fully cover the cost. So, please get rid of the monsters completely.\u201d</p><p>However, Sungwoo knew that he had another plan, and he needed to use Sungwoo to realize the plan.</p><p>\u2018Junghoon is not my enemy. Right now, the immediate task is to break the Evolution Society. So, let me make use of his offer.'</p><p>Sungwoo decided to smash the Evolution Society after hunting the Raid Boss with Junghoon's financial support.</p><p>After talking with Junghoon, Sungwoo visited Hanho and Jisu. They were mixed in with the Crusader Team on standby. When Hanho noticed Sungwoo, he got out of the group and approached him.</p><p>\u201cWow, those guys really love to mingle with me. They're talking too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you already made friends with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they are being friendly to me as if they have formed some kind of friendship after fighting together, but they are still wedded to the thinking that their commander is the strongest.\u201d</p><p>Sungwoo thought that they were under the influence of Junghoon's exclusive skills.</p><p>\u201cAnd the male members are hell bent on winning over Jisu's heart, cracking jokes like \u2018Oh, your red training sweatpants really look good on you'\u2026\u201d</p><p>When Hanho left her behind in the group, it seemed that she was really having a hard time among them.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, did you see the community, Sungwoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, I had no time to check it.\u201d</p><p>Hanho smiled like a pervert and said, \u201cMan, there was a big fuss out there.\u201d</p><p>He was referring to the Necromancer's successful hunting of the Boss Raid in a dramatic reversal of his weak position.</p><p>All the scenes of his heroic fighting were broadcasted live across the country.His awakening from death and becoming Lich with the 1st awakening and his raising Bone Drake were so overwhelming.</p><p>As Junghoon intended, delivering the message of hope to the survivors was a success, although Sungwoo, not Junghoon, claimed the credit.</p><p>\u201cDo you know that they have formed a fan club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I'm embarrassed\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't be surprised. Even Orun has a fan club now.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><p>Hanho turned on his smartphone, turned on the player guidebook application, and opened the ranking page.</p><p>\u201cDr. Zero? That guy reached level 15, then climbed to the third place in the rankings. Youngdungpo Prosecutor is pushed to fourth place. Man, he has almost lost his face.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Sungwoo's eyebrows wriggled momentarily. ID'DOCTOR-000\u2032 was only No. 4 player because of Sungwoo and Junghoon.</p><p>\u2018His ID is Dr?'</p><p>That ID bothered Sungwoo. Given that there were some more IDs similar to that, they were obviously quite a large group.</p><p>\u2018Evolution Society.'</p><p><br></br></p><p>It's highly likely that they were its members because the ID \u2018Dr.' was a nickname that perfectly matched the image of a mad scientist. If Sungwoo's reasoning was correct, it meant that they were growing rapidly.</p><p>\u2018Besides, there are human beasts not compiled in the rankings. They may have a lot of power.'</p><p>At that moment, Minhum approached him and said, \u201cAn unknown object was found inside the station building. The smoke kept coming out because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><p>When Sungwoo made a queer expression, he continued, \u201cWell, it's letting out powerful breath of Abyss. When I approach it, it even penetrates my gas mask. It seems that we can't get rid of it without your help, Sungwoo.\u201d</p><p>An object that is letting out the breath of Abyss?</p><p>It seemed that the Evolution Society left behind one more gift.</p>"}
